What I learned from this course:
1. Responsive design theory
2. Media queries
3. Breakpoints
4. Page layout

Responsive Theory:
In general, responsive design consists of fluid grids, fluid images, and media queries. I have already done some responsive design, but understanding the origins and foundational principles from this course helped me to step into more advanced concepts.

Media Queries:
Media queries are CSS rules that help us include CSS code only when certain conditions are met. These conditions are called media features, and in the case of responsive web design, the media feature most commonly used is width, or more specifically, min-width. However, media queries actually come with many media features, and width is just one of them.

Responsive Patterns:
It's important to consider how different design patterns will translate from one breakpoint to another. Thinking about pieces of atomic design, such as tabs or an image carrousel, is a great way to break down a responsive layout into its component parts.

About this Course
Responsive web design is a collection of techniques for building websites that work on multiple screen sizes. In these lessons, we're going to use the foundational principles of responsive design as a framework for thinking about page layout. By the end, you should have a better understanding of how to approach common decisions in responsive design.

Thank you.
